<h3>1.3 Contributions</h3><br>
<h5>Suraiya Fathima:</h5>
<p align="justify">In this project, my main contributions were centered around analyzing skill alignment,
active skill development, and the relationship between personal interest and career readiness. I worked on understanding how students feel about the alignment of their skills with their current degree. By categorizing the responses based on gender, I was able to identify some clear trends and patterns related to skill alignment.<br><br>

I also analyzed how actively students are working on developing skills outside of their curriculum. By comparing this data across genders, I found some interesting differences in participation levels and how students approach extracurricular skill-building.<br><br>

One of the most important parts of my contribution was conducting a correlation analysis to explore the relationship between skill alignment and personal interest. I focused on how these factors impact students' confidence in achieving their career goals. This analysis showed that students who align their degree with their personal interests and skills tend to feel more confident about their future career paths.<br><br>

Through these tasks, I was able to add meaningful insights to our overall analysis, helping us better understand how skill development and confidence levels are connected to student aspirations.<br><br>

<h5>Muhammed Rinief:</h5>
<p align="justify">
    In this project, my primary contributions revolved around analyzing external influences, personal interest, and their impact on confidence and decision-making in education and career choices. By examining how external recommendations and alternative degree considerations differ across genders, I highlighted significant trends that demonstrate the role of societal and personal influences on students' decisions.<br><br>

My analysis also delved into the relationship between personal interest and confidence levels. The findings revealed that students who chose their degrees based on personal interest exhibited notably higher confidence in achieving their career goals compared to those who did not. This insight underscores the importance of aligning academic pursuits with personal motivations to foster greater engagement and self-assurance.<br><br>

Additionally, I explored how gender impacts receptiveness to external guidance, revealing that female respondents were more influenced by external recommendations and more open to exploring alternative pathways, while male respondents exhibited greater independence and commitment to their initial choices.<br><br>

Through these contributions, I was able to provide key insights into the interplay between external influences, personal interest, and confidence, offering valuable implications for enhancing career counseling strategies and fostering student empowerment in educational and career planning.<br><br>
